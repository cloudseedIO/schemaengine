# SchemaEngine
SchemaEngine is a platform that could be used to build and deploy  scalable social / commerce / enterprise applications without having to write any code.

## Motivation
Instead of spending months coding a concept, we are able to deploy web-scale applications in a matter of days and weeks.

## Description
SchemaEngine is an  application platform as a service (aPaaS) framework to configure and launch enterprise and web-scale applications without any coding.

The codeless application configuration platform used to launch SaaS applications without having to write any code. 

* The business objects are modelled in JSON schemas that may be modified at runtime. 
* Most data types including structs and arrays may be defined. The data types may be flagged for search indexing and filtering of records. 
* The inter-relationships between the schema objects are modelled as 1-many, many-to-many, or 1-1 relationships. 
* View and results-set caching may be enabled to ensure under 10ms response time.
* These may be modified at run-time that allows the application’s behaviour to be updated without a restart.
* The application screens are also configured as a set of JSON templates that are interpreted at run-time allowing for a highly dynamic user-interface generation.
